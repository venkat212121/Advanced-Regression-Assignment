# Project Name
Advance Regression Assignment

## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Conclusions
The Optimal value of alpha is 1.0 in Ridge; 
The optimal value of alpha is 10 in Lasso; 
The r2_score of lasso is slightly higher than ridge for the test dataset;


## Technologies Used
